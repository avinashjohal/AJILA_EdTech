He started the project in May 2021 and discontinued it in August 2023, citing ethical issues and breach of trust by another developer who published a problematic video to the documentation of the project1. Roop has received over 400 commits and 2,000 stars on GitHub1. It has also been forked by other developers who have made some modifications and improvements2"
